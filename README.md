# CSTest 3 Coding Task

Complete the following exercises in GitHub. There is an assignment created for you.
The GitHub document has an outline for the methods that you need to complete..
Instructions are posted within the GitHub ReadMe file, though a copy of the programming tasks can be found below.

**Exercise 1**
Write and test a method called max that returns the value of the larger of the integers x and y (or either one if they are equal). Use if statements to complete your method, but do not use any Math methods.


**Exercise 2**
Fill in the missing code in the totalWages method, which calculates the total earnings for a week based on the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. The pay for overtime hours (hours worked over 40) is 1.5 times the regular rate. For example, totalWages(45, 12.50) should return 593.75. Don’t worry about rounding.


**Exercise 3**
Write a boolean method isLeapYear(int year) that returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4 and either is not divisible by 100 or is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 and 2004 are leap years, but 2003 and 2100 are not.


**Exercise 4**
Fill in the missing code to complete the orderWords method, which returns a string with three words arranged in alphabetical order. For example, orderWords(“dog”, “cat”, “hippo”) should return “cat, dog, hippo”.  Pre-condition, the words are all written in lower case. Utilize the String method compareTo().
